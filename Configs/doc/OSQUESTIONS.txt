While running OpenSim for the first time, you will be asked a few
questions related to the "Estate" and the owner of the regions. Given
that the diva distro comes with 4 regions, you will be asked some of
the questions multiple times. Here is a typical interaction:

...
Your region is not part of an estate.
Do you wish to join an existing estate? [no]: no  <---- first time
New estate name [My Estate]: My Estate
...
The current estate has no owner set.
Estate owner first name [Test]: Test
Estate owner last name [User]: User
Password: 123
Email []: my@email.com
...

The estate questions repeat for the other 3 regions.
Typical answers are:

Do you wish to join an existing estate? [no]: yes <---- other times
Estate name to join [None]: My Estate
