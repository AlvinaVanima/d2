*** Diva Distribution of OpenSim ***

The Diva distribution is a binary distribution. As such, it is much simpler to install than the official OpenSim distribution, which is sources-only. If you come across web pages with instructions for installing OpenSim, please keep this in mind -- this distribution does not need anything related to getting and compiling source code (e.g. git, nant, etc).

Follow these steps for installation of this OpenSim distribution.
 
[If Linux/Unix,
 0 - Install Mono 2.4.2 or higher. See
     MONO.txt
     for important instructions on how to setup mono for
     OpenSim]
     
 1 - Install MySQL and, optionally, MySQLAdmin. See
     MYSQL.txt
     for important instructions on how to setup MySQL for 
     this distribution

     
 2 - Change to bin and run Configure.exe, the application. This will
     start a console application that will automatically configure your
     OpenSim.
     (If in Linux, type 
      $ mono Configure.exe)
     Answer the few questions that it asks.
     If you want to change your answers, run it again.

     
 3 - In bin, run OpenSim.exe, the application. This will start a
     console application.
     (If in Linux, type 
      $ mono OpenSim.exe)

     OpenSim has several console commands, you can learn about them in
     http://opensimulator.org

     For creating a normal user account, type:
     # create user
     
     For flattening the terrain, type:
     # terrain fill 21
     
     For shutting down, type
     # shutdown
     
 That's it for OpenSim! For connecting the client to your world, see

------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATES

To update your world to a newer diva release, simply run the tool
Update.exe

Then, shutdown OpenSim.exe in the old release and start 
OpenSim.exe in the new release.

IMPORTANT: Don't run Configure.exe on your updated diva release,
because that will override your world configuration with a fresh
configuration, and you will loose your previous regions.
