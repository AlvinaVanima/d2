The diva distribution of OpenSim uses Metaverse Ink (MI for short)
services in the following manner:

- During configuration (Configure.exe): MI is invoked via an HTTP call
  for statistical purposes. We don't track the number of downloads, we
  track the number of executions of the configuration tool. The only
  data collected is the public IP address that comes in that HTTP
  call, so that we can have an accurate count of how many machines are
  using this distribution.

- During OpenSim execution: the default configuration of this
  distribution of OpenSim uses MI Search for indexing the public
  (searchable) data of the simulators. This is done in the normal way
  that OpenSim uses indexing and search services. The configuration
  for this service is under the [DataSnapshot] section in file
  DivaPreferences.ini. You can turn it off by overriding it in
  MyWorld.ini, before running OpenSim, like this:

[DataSnapshot]
    index_sims = false

- During updates (Update.exe): MI is invoked via an HTTP call for this
  tool to get new release information, and for statistical purposes.
