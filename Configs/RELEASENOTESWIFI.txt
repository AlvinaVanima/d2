*** Release Notes ***

diva-wifi-0-7-0-2

Thank you Marck for major contributions to Wifi!

*** Changes since previous release:

- Added logos and links to them in the front pages
- Allow configuration of arbitrary default avatars: now not just 3
  (Male, Female, Neutral) but as many as you want. See Wifi
  documentation http://wiki.github.com/diva/d2/wifi
- Restructured style sheet and HTML templates and added fluid style
  sheet replacing the original style.css. Fluid adapts to the size of
  the browser window
- Added support for JavaScript
- Added expansion/contraction of inventory folders
- Added option "Inventory" to the administrator's main menu
- Provided optional variables for displaying version and runtime
  information
- Updated the client download links
- Add column with "Created" date and time to both pending users list
  and accounts list
- Add user title column to user list
- Make user account lists sortable
- Added LoginURI to the activation message


*** Configuration changes:

NOTE: This change affects primarily users running Wifi on a
grid. Users of diva distro installations will have this updated
automatically via DivaPreferences.ini, and should not worry.

The way default avatar types is specified has changed. There used to
be exactly 3 types, specified as
  FemaleAvatarAccount = "Female Avatar"
  MaleAvatarAccount = "Male Avatar"
  NeutralAvatarAccount = "Neutral Avatar"

The syntax has now changed to
  AvatarAccount_Neutral = "Neutral Avatar"
  AvatarAccount_Female = "Female Avatar"
  AvatarAccount_Male = "Male Avatar"

Make sure to update your configuration.

This new syntax enables the existence of an arbitrary number of avatar
types, like this:
  AvatarAccount_<AvatarType> = "<FirstName> <LastName>"

*** Bug fixes since previous release:

- Catch bad To address on sendmail
- Require new accounts to have non-empty first and last names
- Don't send the password by email
- Removed empty rows at the end of lists on composed web pages
- Stay on current page when links "Activate" or "Ignore" are selected
  in empty pending accounts list
- List only non-pending accounts in user search results
- Correct confirmation text for deleting user account
- Fix spelling error in password recovery web page
