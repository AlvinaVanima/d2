*** Release Notes ***

This diva distro is based on 0.6.9(dev). The exact GIT tag
is shown on the name of the zip file.

** Additions 

- There is a new addon module, LibraryModule, that allows sim 
  operators to add arbitrary new content in the OpenSim Library,
  so that it can be used by all users of the local world.
  The library content should be placed as .iar files under bin/Library.
  When the .iar file name partially matches the name of one of the
  existing library subfolders, the content is placed under those;
  top otherwise.

- There are two small .iar files included in the distribution,
  one with outfits and the other with a few objects. Operators can
  add more .iar files to bin/Library; they all add up.

** Changes in configuration preferences

- LibraryModule = true, to enable the library module. 

** Bug fixes in distribution

- the previous release didn't have the image module by mistake

** Bug fixes in OpenSim since previous version of this distro:

- map image is correctly set after hyperlinking
- multi-HG-TPs preserve the home information
