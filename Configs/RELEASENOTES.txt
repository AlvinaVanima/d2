===================== Older release notes ====================

==== r13458 ====

PLEASE READ THESE NOTES CAREFULLY, especially if you are upgrading
from an older release.

This diva distro is based on the official 0.7 release, more
specifically on the 0.7-post-fixes branch. 
The exact GIT tag is shown on the name of the zip file.

This is a major release, with major changes across the board.

** Changes in OpenSim

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release

** Changes in configuration variables

The changes are inumerous. IF YOU GOT THIS RELEASE THROUGH AN UPDATE,
YOU MUST RUN CONFIGURE AGAIN, so that the new configurations are put
in place. 

** Changes in Networking assumptions

This new release features HG 1.5, an improved version of the Hypergrid
architecture that includes a fair amount of security. 
(see http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release#Hypergrid_changes)

This added security imposes a few more constraints on how to set up
your network *properly*. THESE CHANGES AFFECT PRIMARILY HOME NETWORKS,
whose routers often have NAT issues.

Due to these changes, it is advised that people provide domain names
instead of IP addresses in the configurations. In home networks, the
use of an IP address as the external host name of the world may
prevent you from either logging in or hypergriding out (this depends
heavily on your router).

For more information and useful advice, see doc/DNS.txt

** New diva distro addon: Wifi

This new release features an embedded Web application called
Wifi. Wifi handles user registrations to your world.

For more information, see doc/WIFI.txt

** What to expect on first run

If you are upgrading from an older release, your first run of this
release will exhibit unusual behaviors. All subsequent runs will be
normal. Here are some of the things that you should expect from the
first run:

- Startup will take more time. This is due to DB changes. The more
  assets your world has, the longer this takes. Don't interrupt that
  process.
- You will be asked a few questions from OpenSim itself. See 
  doc/OSQUESTIONS.txt
- On first login, avatar appearances will be gone. You need to wear
  them again.
- Home information will be gone. You need to set your home location
  again. 

** Troubleshooting

See http://opensimulator.org/wiki/0.7_Release#Troubleshooting

- Feet stand on the ground instead of in the ground
- Almost all of LSL implemented
- Fixes prim to prim collision

==== r11766 ====

** Additions 

- There is a new addon module, LibraryModule, that allows sim 
  operators to add arbitrary new content in the OpenSim Library,
  so that it can be used by all users of the local world.
  The library content should be placed as .iar files under bin/Library.
  When the .iar file name partially matches the name of one of the
  existing library subfolders, the content is placed under those;
  top otherwise.

- There are two small .iar files included in the distribution,
  one with outfits and the other with a few objects. Operators can
  add more .iar files to bin/Library; they all add up.

** Changes in configuration preferences

- LibraryModule = true, to enable the library module. 

** Bug fixes in distribution

- the previous release didn't have the image module by mistake

** Bug fixes in OpenSim since previous version of this distro:

- map image is correctly set after hyperlinking
- multi-HG-TPs preserve the home information

==== r11651 ====

** Changes in configuration preferences

- AllowOSFunctions = true, with Moderate threat level. This will 
  enable the basic OS functions. This is a Diva preference, and,
  as with all preferences, can be overriden in MyWorld.ini

** Bug fixes in OpenSim since previous version of this distro:

- landing on prims works again
- several performance improvements and increased stability
- load oar now has a merge facility
  (see http://opensimulator.org/wiki/OpenSim_Archives)
