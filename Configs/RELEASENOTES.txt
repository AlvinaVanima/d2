==== r11766 ====

** Additions 

- There is a new addon module, LibraryModule, that allows sim 
  operators to add arbitrary new content in the OpenSim Library,
  so that it can be used by all users of the local world.
  The library content should be placed as .iar files under bin/Library.
  When the .iar file name partially matches the name of one of the
  existing library subfolders, the content is placed under those;
  top otherwise.

- There are two small .iar files included in the distribution,
  one with outfits and the other with a few objects. Operators can
  add more .iar files to bin/Library; they all add up.

** Changes in configuration preferences

- LibraryModule = true, to enable the library module.
