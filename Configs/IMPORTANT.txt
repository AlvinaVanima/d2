#	           ATTENTION                  #
# If upgrading from latest releases, there is #
# nothing to do. Change to that directory and #
# start OpenSim there. Have fun!              #

# See RELEASENOTES.txt for important          #

#                                             #
# If upgrading from releases prior to r15402: #
#                                             #
#     --- RECONFIGURATION RECOMMENDED ---     #
#                                             #
# In order to take advantage of the new       #
# features (especially HG friends and IM)     #
# you must reconfigure your world.            #
# Before running the new version, go to       #
# the new installation folder and run:        #
#                                             #
# $ [mono] Configure.exe                      #
#                                             #
# Answer the questions with the exact same    #
# data that you have in your current          #
# config-include/MyWorld.ini                  #
# If you had made additional changes to       #
# MyWorld.ini, make sure to port those to the #
# new MyWorld.ini after running Configure.exe #
#                                             #
