First, register hgtp:// moniker by running

Launcher.exe -register

This will allow you to launch a second life viewer from a web page with the url

hgtp://osgrid.org:8002/

which launches the viewer with the arg

-loginuri http://osgrid.org:8002/

Have a look at hgtpTest.htm for an example.

If the launcher cannot locate a viewer, it will ask to download the latest SL viewer installer and run it. If you press 'Yes', it will do so for you (and then you're supposed to try again)

At the moment, there is no progress indicator of the download. You simply have to wait.

So, lots of room for improvement.

It would be fun to try and incorporate linux and mac support into the launcher.
